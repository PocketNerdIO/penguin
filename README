EDisAsm - EPOC 16 Disassembler/Dumper
=====================================

This utility is an exploratory tool developed for the investigation into
porting Linux to the SIBO architecture.  



WARNING
========
It might crash your Psion - you have been warned. We accept no responsibility
for any data loss that might occur as a result of you running this on your
Psion. It probably doesn't work on the emulator.



HOPEFUL LEGAL DISCLAIMER
++++++++++++++++++++++++
This kit allows you to investigate the EPOC ROM. It provides a tool to
generate a raw dump of part of your Psion's ROM on your PC, and a commentary on
some of the routines and features found there. It doesn't include an actual
listing. It also contains a script which may be used to merge a listing which
you must produce, and this commentary, to provide a commented listing.

These tools have precedents: the Psionics Files provide descriptions of the
functions provided by the EPOC ROM, their interrupt numbers, function numbers
and parameters. The HexView program by Konstantin Saliy allows you to
investigate the memory of your Psion. 

The 'new' function provided by EDisAsm is the saving of arbitrary memory ranges onto your PC hard disk for later perusal. These may include your own programs'
memory, or the ROM areas.  (i.e. it's a useful debugging tool)

The 'new' information provided in the 3cdesc.txt file is the locations in ROM
memory of the routines pointed to by the interrupt vector table on a particular
SIBO system - the Series 3c - and sundry other descriptions of 3c ROM routines
and data areas.

This software and information is provided for informational purposes only.

Distribution of a commented listing MIGHT contravene Psion's statement in the
SIBO C SDK that "reverse engineering is prohibited", therefore, you must
produce this listing yourself and not redistribute it.  I won't send you
listings, commented or otherwise, or ROM image files. 

It is hoped that the 3cdesc.txt file DOES NOT CONSTITUTE reverse engineering,
merely an extension of the body of knowledge present in the Psionics files.

I have posted to Usenet, asking for clarification on what, exactly, we could
publish of our findings of the SIBO hardware, using this information.
Hopefully, I'll receive a clarification soon. 

If Psion/Symbian decide that we cannot publish the kind of information present
in the 3cdesc.txt file, I will remove this archive, and cease distribution of
it. 

The object of the exercise is to write device drivers for Linux for the ASIC9
hardware. Information necessary to achieve this is not present in the SIBO C
SDK, nor in the HDK documentation. (although ASIC1/2 are well-documented).

Therefore, to obtain this information, we have had to investigate EPOC's usage
of the hardware.  Unless information can be obtained about the I/O port usage
of ASIC9, this project cannot continue, and will be terminated.

I STRESS THAT DISASSEMBLY OF THE EPOC ROM IS NOT THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT!  If
I'm told to cease publication of this material, I will do so.  Please mail me -

civilised ;-) 



Quick instructions to generate a commented ROM listing
------------------------------------------------------
Use the INSTALL.BAT script to install EDISASM.APP on your Psion 
(COM2, 19200 baud - adjust the MCLINK.TRM file if you're using MCLINK).

Install on the System Screen, and run EDisAsm on your Psion.

Run MCLINK/RCOM/PsiWin on your PC. Keep your Psion Link active.

Type 'help' in EDisAsm.

Various commands shown there will enable you to save a ROM image file on your
PC. (try 'sendrom384', which will save ROM384.MEM on your PC - it's 384KB in 
size, and holds the fixed ROM memory area image.)

Type 'exit' in EDisAsm. Close MCLINK.

You'll be able to generate a listing of ROM384.MEM using your favourite 
disassembler. (SID, DEBUG, NDISASM, IDA, etc)

3cdesc.txt contains a 'commentary' on the 3c's ROM routines - IT IS NOT A 
LISTING OF THE ROM!  It contains a list of the interrupt vectors, and comments
which can be used to annotate a listing of the ROM.

annotate is a perl script which takes the listing of the ROM, produced above,
and the 3cdesc.txt file, and merges them to provide a listing of the ROM, with
comments. e.g. all interrupt vector entry points will be commented with the
name of their function.
